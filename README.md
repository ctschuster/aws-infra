# Repo "aws-infra"

Demo Infrastructure for AWS


## Description

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the expressive power of terraform
for development of IaC and also a model of infrastructure to be used in AWS.
The development and public availability of this repo has grown out of coaching /
training efforts.


## Limitations

Actual deployment of the AWS structure contained herein requires an AWS account
and specifics like account names, account numbers, perhaps dns & server names, etc.
Some of these will be treated documentation, but the principal purpose of this
repo is for demonstrating infrastructure and development patterns.  To maintain
this as ready-to-deploy is presently a secondary consideration but should be
achieved by the time of maturation of the codebase.
